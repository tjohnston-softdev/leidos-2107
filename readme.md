# Leidos Case Study Assessment - July 2021

This is my submission for a case study assessment given to shortlisted job applicants for a 'Junior-Mid Software Developer'.  role with the Information Technology company [Leidos](https://www.leidos.com/). The idea of the assessment was to review a hypothetical IT problem and conduct research as to how the problem can be mitigated as much as possible.

My submission for this case study assessment was originally written across 2-6 July 2021. It was later converted to markdown on 8 August, and shared publicly on 7 September.
